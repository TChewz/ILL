New Features that need testing:

22/06/16

Added: New loading screen (May change in the near future)
Added: New Loading Intro
Added: Panic buttton - Cops will now have access to a panic button, they will need to press it twice in order for it to call for urgent backup. Must only be used if your life is in complete danger. basically a call for SWAT. has a 5 minute cooldown.

Changed: UO Based has been changed to a newer, much nicer looking base (thanks Muziqh)

Fixed: The PIT script - Whenever you were pitted and you left the vehicle before the PIT script finished, you would receive the PIT effect on every vehicle you use, now (hopefully) fixed.
Fixed: Speed Upgrade 4 and Speed Upgrade 5 (my bad)
Fixed: Ammo for Hk417 in Marshalls box at DOJ, now 7.62mm instead of 5.56mm (my bad)
Fixed: A bunch of errors appearing in the logs, should help with your FPS as well.

General error fixing (which took the most time), recoding of some aspects of the mission and implementing more checks for some features to make the mission more stable.
